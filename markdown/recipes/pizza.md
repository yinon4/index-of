# Napolitan Pizza

## Ingredients

- 1 cup water (240g), warmed to 35° C
- ¾ cup milk (160g), warmed to 35° C
- 1.5 tsp granulated sugar (5g)
- 1 tbsp instant yeast (9g)
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil (20g)
- 1.5 tsp salt (9g)
- 4-4.5 cups Type 00 Flour (670g)
- Cornmeal or Semolina for dusting

## Instructions

### Pizza Dough

1. In a stand mixer, combine warm milk, water, sugar, yeast, olive oil, and salt. Gradually add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides and feels tacky.
2. Mix for 7-8 minutes until smooth. Let rise in a covered bowl for about an hour until doubled.

### Shaping and Baking

1. Preheat the pizza oven for at least 30 minutes.
2. Punch down the dough, divide into 6 portions (about 175g each), shape into balls, and let rest for 15 minutes.
3. On a cornmeal-dusted surface, stretch one dough ball into a 6-8 inch circle. Top with 2-3 tbsp pizza sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil, and parmesan if desired.
4. Place the pizza in the oven. Cook for 45 seconds, then turn and cook for another 30-45 seconds.

## Notes

- **Type 00 Flour:** Essential for Neapolitan pizza; can be found online or at select stores.
- **Oven:** Best in a pizza oven, but can be made in a regular oven at maximum temperature (550°F) with a pre-heated pizza stone for 5-7 minutes.
