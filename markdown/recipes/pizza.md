# Neapolitan Pizza

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 kg pizza flour
- 2-10 g dry yeast
- 30 g salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 600-650 ml water
- 1 tbsp honey

### Sauce

- canned tomatoes (or fresh, blended)
- thyme
- oregano
- garlic

## Instructions

### Pizza Dough

1. In a stand mixer, combine the water, honey, yeast, olive oil, and salt. Gradually add the flour until the dough pulls away from the sides and feels tacky.
2. Mix for 7-8 minutes until smooth. Let rise in a covered bowl for about an hour or until doubled.

### Preparing the Sauce

1. In a bowl, combine the canned tomatoes, dried thyme, dried oregano, and minced garlic. Mix well and set aside.

### Shaping and Baking

1. Preheat the pizza oven for at least 30 minutes.
2. Punch down the dough, divide into portions, shape into balls, and let rest for 15 minutes.
3. On a cornmeal-dusted surface, stretch one dough ball into a circle. Top with sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil, and parmesan if desired.
4. Place the pizza in the oven. Cook for 45 seconds, then turn and cook for another 30-45 seconds.
