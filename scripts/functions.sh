# Create a single index.md file
# takes a directory as an argument
  # means no relative path :(
    # Index of /basename NOT /path/to/basename

# Convert a single file from markdown to html (including relative paths)
# takes a relative path and an output path as arguments



# Script:
# doesn't take any arguments looks for markdown/ and outputs to docs/
# goes through all directories and creates an index.md file for each directory
# converts all markdown files to html files
